# Machine-Learning
This is a course that I took in pursuit of my master's degree in Data Analytics. 
The objectives learned in this machine language (ML) course taught me how to:
• Understand exposure to the realm of analyzing data and abstract reasoning.
• Develop an appreciation for the ubiquity of BIG DATA in the everyday life of individuals
and that of society.
